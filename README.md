# FAQ-Telegram-Bot
A simple open-sourced Telegram bot written in Python to assist small businesses to setup a simple and automated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section without the need for a business website. This eliminates the need to design and host a fully functional website, thus, streamlining the entire process.

There are plans to expand on this project, including but not limited to an automated retail store feature without official built-in payment.
